                  heading back to sit with mum and dad for the rest of the 
                  Mass.<BR><BR>The Service of the Word is intended to introduce 
                  the teachings of Christ and the Gospel in a more relaxed 
                  manner better suited to children and their somewhat short 
                  attention spans.<BR><BR>Each week, the children thank God for 
                  all the good things that have happened to them and ask the 
                  Lord for forgiveness for any of their 
                  shortcomings.<BR><BR>They listen to a gospel story and then 
                  discuss it. The younger children will often colour in a 
                  picture that relates to one of the day’s readings. Later the 
                  children will pray for those they love and for the needs of 
                  others in the world.<BR><BR>By taking this approach, children 
                  are introduced to the Word of God in a way they enjoy and 
                  understand, which in turn will help nourish their faith as 
                  they grow older. <BR><BR>If you would like your child to take 
                  part in the Service of the Word just bring them to the back of 
                  the church before Mass and help them to line up with the other 
                  children gathered there.<BR><BR>If you want to help out talk
